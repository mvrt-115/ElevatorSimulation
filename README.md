# Elevator Simulation

 
**Goal: To Simulate an elevator subsystem for the 2018 game.** 
[Power Up Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDOd-OSOr60&feature=emb_logo) for those who are unfamiliar with the 2018 game. Elevators were used to place Cubes at different heights. 


**Code Requirements** 
The code for this simulation should be able to be deployed and work on a real robot without changing any code. You can use ```RobotBase.isreal()``` to check whether you are connected to an actual robot or running a simulation. 

The elevator has three setpoints: Bottom (0m), Middle (2m), Top (3m). Use buttons on Shuffleboard to move between the different setpoints. This can be done by by  ```SmartDashboard.putData("Button Name", new Command());```

Follow Command Based Structure, creating subsystem(s) and command(s) as needed

Use the ElevatorSim class as part of the WPILib Physics Simulation

Write the PID loop from scratch without using the WPI or CTRE libraries for PID Resources for PID:

Use Shuffleboard to plot your motor output, elevator position, buttons, and other information
 
Mess around with the gains for P, I, & D and see how changing each one affects your output

*Example plots on Shuffleboard*
 
**Additional Information:**
* Carriage Mass: 15 pounds
* Max Elevator Height: 11 feet
* Gear Ratio: 10:1 reduction
* Pulley Radius: 2 inches
* Elevator Motor: 2 775 pro’s controlled by 2 TalonSRX’s. (Use WPI_TalonSRX)
* Ticks/Revolution: 4096 (ticks are the unit of the encoder, 4096 encoder ticks = 1 rotation)

*Make sure to pay attention to units*
 
Create a branch of this repository with your name as the branch title. When you are finished with your code, make a commit titled “DONE”
 
**Optional**: Create a functional Limit Switch (you can manipulate its value through the Simulation GUI or create a wrapper that automatically changes the value based on the elevator position)
 
**Additional Projects:**
Here are some other optional projects you can work on with Robot Simulation. Feel free to explore other projects as well. [Chief Delphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/)  is a great resource to use. 
* Use WPILib’s motion profiling libraries to complete the Infinite Recharge at Home driving courses: https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/infinite-recharge-at-home-autonav-challenges-using-wpilibs-drive-simulator/390485 
* Simulate the 2020 or any robot, simulating multiple subsystems
* Replace PID with motion profiling (Implementation: https://youtu.be/wqJ4tY0u6IQ) 
* Create a 1D motion profile generator
